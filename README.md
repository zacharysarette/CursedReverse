# ![Cursed Reverse Logo](<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharysarette/CursedReverse/%24/logo.png>) CursedReverse 

A cursed string arg reversing thing-a-ma script

---

## Story

Take a look at the source of CursedReverse.js.

I made this as an excercise to answer a question about functional programming in JS that someone had. 

I told them to run this line in the console and figure out how it works. 

I would probably not push code like this to production, but it is quite a neat demonstration of what the language can do.


## Usage

```shell
node CursedReverse.js this is an example
```

output:

```shell
elpmaxe na si siht
```
